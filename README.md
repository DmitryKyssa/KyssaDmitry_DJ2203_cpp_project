Project in C++

Scope: to create a card game

Game rules: At the beginning of the game, the deck of cards is shuffled in a random order. The player and NPC each receive 6 cards. The suit of the first remaining card is declared trump. The first move is made by the one who has the minimum card of the trump suit (the minimum value is 6, the maximum is Ace). The card can be covered either with another card of the same suit, but of a higher value, or with any trump card. The player can play against his opponent only those cards whose values are present in the current draw. After each move, you need to get up to 6 cards. The winner is the one who has no more cards.
