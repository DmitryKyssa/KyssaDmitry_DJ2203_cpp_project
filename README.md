Project in C++

Scope: to create a card game like 101/Mau-Mau

Game rules: The aim is to be first to get rid of all of one's cards. The players are each dealt a hand of 4 cards. The rest are placed face down as the stock or stack. At the beginning of the game the topmost card is revealed and placed face up on the table then the players take it in turns to play their cards. A card can only be played if it corresponds to the suit or value of the face-up card.
The 7, 8, Jack, and Ace of all suits are significant cards:

  If a 7 is played, the next player has to draw two cards but may play. (A variant of the game allows the player facing the 7 to play another 7, in which case the player to their left must take 4 cards from the pack, unless they too play a 7, in which case the player to their left must take 6 cards from the pack, unless they too play a 7, in which case the player to their left must take 8 cards from the pack.)
  Any 8 forces the next player to miss their turn. (A variant of the game allows the player facing the 8 to play another 8, in which case the next player after them must play another 8 or miss a turn, etc.)
  A Jack of any suit is the equivalent of a Joker and can be played on any card. The player who plays it then chooses a card suit. The next player then plays as if the Jack was of the chosen suit.
  If an Ace is played, one other card must be played with it. If the player does not have another card, or cannot follow in suit or number, then the player must take a card from the pack. If a player's final card is an Ace, they cannot win on that turn.
